        <h1 id="#about-a-Dachshund"> About Dachshund</h1>
        <p> The famously long, low silhouette, ever-alert expression, and bold, vivacious personality of the Dachshund have made him
        a superstar of the canine kingdom. Dachshunds come in two sizes and in three coat types of various colors and patterns.
        The word 'icon' is terribly overworked, but the Dachshund'with his unmistakable long-backed body, little legs, and big
        personality'is truly an icon of purebred dogdom. Dachshunds can be standard-sized (usually 16 to 32 pounds) or miniature
        (11 pounds or under), and come in one of three coat types: smooth, wirehaired, or longhaired. Dachshunds aren't built
        for distance running, leaping, or strenuous swimming, but otherwise these tireless hounds are game for anything. Smart
        and vigilant, with a big-dog bark, they make fine watchdogs. Bred to be an independent hunter of dangerous prey, they
        can be brave to the point of rashness, and a bit stubborn, but their endearing nature and unique look has won millions
        of hearts the world over.</p>

          <h2>Smooth Hair</h2>
            <p>The majority of U.S. dachshunds have smooth coats. These coats are soft, short, shiny, and dense. They also require very
            little grooming.</p>

          <h2>Long Hair</h2>
              <p>Long-haired dachshunds have long, silky hair, which was likely developed to protect these hunting dogs from the
              elements.</p>

          <h2>Wired Hair</h2>
                <p>Wire-haired dachshunds have medium-length, coarse, slightly wavy hair that gives them a ‚Äúrough‚Äù appearance. They also
                have (amazingly cute) facial hair, which makes them pretty easy to recognize.</p>
